# RR_Project-Housing-Price-Dynamics-in-King-Cunty-WA
Enhancing reproducible research from Data Exploration to Advanced Analysis

## Project Summary

This project uses advanced data visualization techniques in Python to analyze house prices in King County, Washington. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle (link here), provides 21,613 observations of 21 distinct variables over a one-year span (May 2014 - May 2015).
Objectives

The objective of this project is two-fold:

    Develop advanced visualizations that allow us to explore relationships between variables and understand patterns in house sales data.
    Identify and interpret factors that contribute to the variations in house values.

## Data Description

The dataset consists of both numerical and categorical variables, covering various aspects like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living space, lot size, etc. The geographical coverage is King County, including the city of Seattle.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Through the use of several R packages such as ggplot2 and plotly, we will carry out thorough data exploration. This includes correlation analysis, distribution analysis and other related techniques to help understand the underpinnings of our data.
Advanced Visualization Techniques

Our project makes use of scatter plot matrices, interactive visualizations, and custom plots to delve deeper into the data. To enhance aesthetics and interactivity, we will leverage extensions of ggplot2.

## Geospatial Visualization

Given that our dataset provides geographical coordinates, we will create maps to visualize the spatial distribution of house prices within King County and Seattle. The idea is to identify regional patterns and hotspots of high-value properties.

## Machine Learning Modeling

TBD...

## Conclusion

Overall, through the use of advanced visualization techniques, this project aims to deliver valuable insights into the factors influencing house sales in King County, Washington. The blend of exploratory data analysis with visual representations will pave the way towards a comprehensive understanding of housing market dynamics within the region.
